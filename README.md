## 🧠 Contents

This repository includes notes and slides from various core computer science subjects:

- **Computer Organization and Architecture** – CPU design, instruction cycles, memory hierarchy, I/O systems  
- **Algorithms and Data Structures** – time complexity, sorting, trees, graphs, recursion, dynamic programming  
- **Object-Oriented Programming** – principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism with Java examples  
- **Web Development** – fundamentals of front-end and back-end design, REST APIs, and full-stack projects  
- **Software Engineering and Construction** – software lifecycle, design patterns, testing, and project documentation  

Each topic includes **slides**, **code examples**, and **summarized notes** for quick review and practical understanding.
